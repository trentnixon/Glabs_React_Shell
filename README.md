## Adding an Application

The template allows for easy integration of any client react applications as developed by Glabs. Applications are downloaded separately and manually installed.
- 1: Clone base application from git.
- 2: Move Application files to Template Structure:
```
-src
-js
		-Application
```
Each Application should come with a ReadMe file for any specific Application Installation steps

- 3: Link Application to the Template
```
Main.js : Line 6
Component Name can also be amended from “Default” to “Application Name”
```
- 4: Move Application.json
	```
	Move Application.json file found in “[Application Name]/Json” to “Public/Json”. 
Load.js should be hooked up to read this file now.
```
- 5:Include new path to Application Reducers
	```
	“src/reducer/index.js” 
           Update the APP path to the  [Application Name]/reducer file
```
- 6:Hook up Actions
```
	Insure path to “store” is correct
```
