## Adding an Application

The template allows for easy integration of any client react applications as developed by Glabs. Applications are downloaded separately and manually installed.
- 1: Clone base application from git.
- 2: Move Application files to Template Structure:
```
-src
   -js
       -Application
```
Each Application should come with a ReadMe file for any specific Application Installation steps

- 3: Link Application to the Template
```
   -src
       -js
           -pages
               -Main.js : Line 6
               // Application
               import Default from "../Application/Default/Default";
  
               Imported Component Name can also be amended from “Default” to “Application Name of choice”

--- Include Application Styles
 -src
     -css
            -pages
                  -_Main.scss
             Amend line:22 to path to @import the  Global Application scss file.
```
- 4: Move Application.json
```
    Move Application.json file found in
          
           -js
               -Application
                   -json/Application.json
           to
           -Public
               -Json

           Overwrite or append to file in this folder
           Load.js will be hooked up to read this file.
```

- 5: Include new path to Application Reducers and uncomment Reducer Instance

```
    -src
       -reducer
           -index.js
       Update the APP path to the   Application Name]/reducer file
       //import APP from "../js/[Application Name]/reducers/Application.js";
  
       Uncomment Line:8
       //APP:APP
```

- 6: Hook up Actions

```
    Insure path to “store” is correct
```


## Theming Template and Applications
Global Theming of the Template and Applications
Scss theme files can be found:
```
-src
    -css
         -scss
              -Theme
                    _Theme_Colors.scss
                    _Theme_Fonts.scss
                    _Theme_Typography.scss
         _Mixin.scss
        _variables.scss
```

Amend Colors, Fonts and Type Variables in these files. These should be enough to amend the Shell for any campaign.
Application Styles should be done within the Application scss folder!
